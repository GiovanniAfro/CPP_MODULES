# C++ Module 07 - Exercises Overview

## Introduction to C++ Templates

Module 07 delves into the powerful concept of C++ templates, which enable the writing of generic and reusable code. This module covers function templates, class templates, and advanced template usage to handle complex tasks efficiently. Templates are essential for developing flexible, type-safe code that works with any data type.

## Exercises Overview

### Exercise 00: Start with a few functions

#### Purpose

To introduce function templates by implementing generic functions (`swap`, `min`, `max`) that can operate on any data type supporting comparison operators. This exercise demonstrates the versatility of templates in simplifying code maintenance and enhancement.

#### Key Concepts

- Function templates
- Generic programming
- Template instantiation and specialization

### Exercise 01: Iter

#### Purpose

Develop a function template `iter` that applies a given function to every element of an array. This exercise expands on the concept of function templates to include passing functions as parameters, further showcasing the flexibility of templates.

#### Key Concepts

- Templated function pointers
- Iterating over array elements using templates
- Applying operations generically to any sequence

### Exercise 02: Array

#### Purpose

Create a class template `Array` that encapsulates a dynamic array and provides typical container behaviors. This exercise focuses on using class templates to implement custom container classes that are as robust as standard library containers but tailored for specific needs.

#### Key Concepts

- Class templates
- Dynamic memory management
- Exception handling in template classes

## Submission and Peer Evaluation

Ensure your template implementations are robust, handle edge cases, and follow the coding standards specified. Your solutions should demonstrate not only functional correctness but also efficient use of templates to reduce code redundancy and increase flexibility.

**Leverage these exercises to deepen your understanding of C++ templates, a cornerstone for developing high-performance, reusable software components.**

### Good luck!
