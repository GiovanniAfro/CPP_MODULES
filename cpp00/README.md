# Exercises Overview - C++ Module 00

## Exercise 00: Megaphone

### Purpose

**Megaphone** serves as a warm-up to get you started with the basics of C++ input and output streams. The goal of this exercise is to create a program that amplifies any input it receives, echoing it back in uppercase. This will help you understand how to handle command-line arguments in C++, manipulate strings, and output results. It's designed to test your ability to create a simple and functional C++ program that interacts with the user.

### Key Concepts

- Command-line arguments
- String manipulation
- Standard input/output streams

## Exercise 01: My Awesome PhoneBook

### Purpose

**My Awesome PhoneBook** introduces you to the basics of class design in C++, focusing on how to manage objects in memory without dynamic allocation. This exercise challenges you to build a simple yet functional phonebook application that can add, search, and display contacts using a class-based system. This will deepen your understanding of arrays, classes, and basic data management in C++, preparing you for more complex data structures.

### Key Concepts

- Class design and implementation
- Array manipulation
- Simple memory management

## Exercise 02: The Job Of Your Dreams

### Purpose

**The Job Of Your Dreams** is designed to simulate a real-world scenario where you must reconstruct a missing piece of a software application. This exercise will test your ability to read and understand existing code bases, implement functionality that integrates seamlessly with pre-existing systems, and use logs to debug and verify functionality. It's a comprehensive test of your problem-solving skills and your ability to work with complex C++ code structures.

### Key Concepts

- Code reconstruction
- Header file integration
- Debugging and logging

## Submission and Peer Evaluation

Ensure your solutions are clear, well-commented, and adhere to the given specifications. Remember, your code will not only be evaluated for correctness but also for readability and adherence to the standards specified in the General Rules section.

**Challenge yourself, and happy coding!**
