# C++ Module 09 - Standard Template Library (STL)

## Overview

Module 09 dives into the extensive capabilities of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). This module is designed to strengthen your understanding and skills in utilizing STL components including containers, iterators, and algorithms to efficiently solve complex programming problems.

## Learning Objectives

- **Master STL Containers**: Learn to effectively use various STL containers like vectors, lists, maps, and sets.
- **Explore STL Algorithms**: Implement different STL algorithms to perform common operations such as sorting, searching, and transforming collections.
- **Advanced Iterator Usage**: Gain proficiency in using iterators for seamless navigation and manipulation of data within containers.
- **Robust Exception Handling**: Enhance the robustness of your C++ applications by properly handling exceptions.

## Exercises Description

### Exercise 00: Bitcoin Exchange

Develop a program that reads historical Bitcoin prices from a CSV file and calculates the value of Bitcoin on specific dates provided by the user.

**Key Concepts:**
- File I/O
- Data parsing and processing using STL containers
- Exception handling for data integrity and error management

### Exercise 01: Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)

Create a Reverse Polish Notation calculator that evaluates mathematical expressions provided in postfix notation.

**Key Concepts:**
- Use of `std::stack` or `std::queue` to manage operations
- Parsing and evaluating string-based commands
- Error handling for unsupported operations and malformed inputs

### Exercise 02: PmergeMe

Implement a sorting program that uses the merge-insert (Ford-Johnson) algorithm to sort large datasets.

**Key Concepts:**
- Performance comparison of different STL containers
- Implementation of a complex sorting algorithm
- Efficient data management and exception handling
