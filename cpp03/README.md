# C++ Module 03 - Exercises Overview

## Introduction to Inheritance

Module 03 explores the concept of inheritance in C++, an essential feature of Object-Oriented Programming that allows classes to inherit properties and behaviors from other classes. You will learn how to create class hierarchies that reflect real-world relationships and promote code reuse and abstraction.

## Exercise 00: Aaaaand... OPEN!

### Purpose

This exercise introduces you to the basics of creating classes and implementing simple behaviors in those classes. You will develop a `ClapTrap` class with functionalities such as attacking, taking damage, and repairing itself. This will serve as a foundation for understanding class construction, member functions, and private attributes.

### Key Concepts

- Class definition and implementation
- Constructors and destructors
- Member functions and encapsulation
- Basic class interactions

## Exercise 01: Serena, my love!

### Purpose

Expanding on the ClapTrap class, this exercise delves deeper into inheritance by creating a `ScavTrap` class derived from `ClapTrap`. You will learn about constructor and destructor chaining and how derived classes can modify behavior of base classes while adding new functionalities.

### Key Concepts

- Inheritance and constructor chaining
- Overriding member functions
- Enhancing functionality in derived classes

## Exercise 02: Repetitive work

### Purpose

By implementing a `FragTrap` class that also inherits from `ClapTrap`, this exercise emphasizes the versatility and reusability of base class code in multiple derived classes. It introduces the concept of differentiating behaviors among sibling classes sharing a common base.

### Key Concepts

- Multiple inheritance from the same base class
- Specialized behaviors in derived classes
- Construction and destruction order in inheritance hierarchies

## Exercise 03: Now it’s weird!

### Purpose

The culmination of this module’s lessons on inheritance, the `DiamondTrap` class, inherits from both `ScavTrap` and `FragTrap`. This exercise will challenge you to manage complex inheritance schemes (including the diamond problem) and utilize multiple base classes effectively.

### Key Concepts

- Multiple inheritance and the diamond problem
- Utilizing features from multiple base classes
- Unique identifier management in complex class hierarchies

## Submission and Peer Evaluation

Ensure your code is thoroughly tested, well-documented, and adheres to the coding standards provided. The clarity of your implementation and the functionality of your classes will be crucial during peer evaluations.
