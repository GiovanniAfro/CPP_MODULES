# C++ Module 02 - Exercises Overview

## Exercise 00: My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form

### Purpose

This initial exercise introduces you to the Orthodox Canonical Form for class design in C++. You will create a class that represents fixed-point numbers, a numeric type that provides a balance between precision and range, often used where floating-point arithmetic is deemed too imprecise. This exercise sets the foundation for understanding custom data types and the importance of class lifecycle management in C++.

### Key Concepts

- Orthodox Canonical Form (Default constructor, Copy constructor, Copy assignment operator, Destructor)
- Fixed-point arithmetic
- Class lifecycle management

## Exercise 01: Towards a more useful fixed-point number class

### Purpose

Building on the fixed-point number class from Exercise 00, this exercise enhances its utility by enabling conversions from and to integer and floating-point formats. Additionally, you will implement operator overloading for output, enriching the class's usability in practical scenarios such as computational tasks and debugging.

### Key Concepts

- Constructor overloading
- Conversion methods
- Operator overloading (`<<` for output)

## Exercise 02: Now we’re talking

### Purpose

In this exercise, you will add a comprehensive suite of operator overloads to the fixed-point number class, including arithmetic and comparison operators. This will not only improve your understanding of operator overloading but also demonstrate the power of ad-hoc polymorphism in creating intuitive and efficient classes.

### Key Concepts

- Overloading arithmetic and comparison operators
- Implementing increment/decrement operators
- Advanced ad-hoc polymorphism

## Exercise 03: BSP

### Purpose

Using the fixed-point number class, you will create a `Point` class and implement a function to determine if a point lies within a given triangle—a fundamental problem in computational geometry. This exercise emphasizes the utility of the classes you've developed in solving real-world geometric problems.

### Key Concepts

- Geometric problem solving
- Binary space partitioning
- Implementing and using the `Point` class in practical scenarios

## Submission and Peer Evaluation

Make sure your submitted code is clean, well-commented, and adheres to the naming and formatting conventions specified in the module documentation. Remember that your code will be evaluated not just for functionality but also for readability and adherence to best practices.

**Challenge yourself, learn consistently, and strive to write code that not only works but is also easy to read and maintain!**
