# C++ Module 06 - Exercises Overview

## Introduction to C++ Casts

Module 06 dives into the nuances of C++ casting mechanisms, providing a comprehensive exploration of scalar type conversions, serialization techniques, and type identification without runtime type information (RTTI). This module is crucial for understanding the safe and effective handling of type conversions in C++.

## Exercises Overview

### Exercise 00: Conversion of scalar types

#### Purpose

Implement a `ScalarConverter` class that handles explicit conversions between C++ scalar types. This exercise focuses on understanding and applying different C++ cast types to perform safe and predictable conversions.

#### Key Concepts

- Static casting
- Dynamic casting
- Reinterpret casting
- Const casting

### Exercise 01: Serialization

#### Purpose

Develop a `Serializer` class to explore serialization concepts in C++, specifically focusing on converting between pointers and integer types safely. This exercise will solidify understanding of low-level data handling and pointer arithmetic.

#### Key Concepts

- Serialization techniques
- Pointer arithmetic
- Safe conversion between types using `uintptr_t`

### Exercise 02: Identify real type

#### Purpose

Create a base class with derived types and implement methods to determine the real type of an object at runtime without using RTTI. This challenges you to use advanced C++ features to simulate dynamic type identification.

#### Key Concepts

- Advanced use of C++ casts
- Type identification without `typeinfo`
- Virtual destructors and class hierarchies

## Submission and Peer Evaluation

Ensure your code is robust, adheres to the specified standards, and demonstrates a clear understanding of C++ casting mechanisms. Your implementations will be evaluated not only for correctness but also for adherence to best practices in type safety and conversion accuracy.

**Enhance your C++ skills by mastering these advanced concepts, essential for writing sophisticated, safe, and efficient software.**

### Good luck!:D
