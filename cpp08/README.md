# C++ Module 08 - Exercises Overview

## Introduction to Templated Containers, Iterators, and Algorithms

Module 08 focuses on the advanced usage of C++ templates in the context of standard template library (STL) containers, iterators, and algorithms. This module is essential for understanding how to efficiently manipulate collections of data using the powerful tools provided by the C++ standard library.

## Exercises Overview

### Exercise 00: Easy find

#### Purpose

To start simple, implement a function template `easyfind` that encapsulates the search logic to find the first occurrence of a given integer in any STL-compatible container. This exercise demonstrates the application of templates to common tasks in container manipulation.

#### Key Concepts

- Templated functions
- STL containers and iterator usage
- Exception handling for not found conditions

### Exercise 01: Span

#### Purpose

Develop a `Span` class that can handle a maximum number of integers and can determine both the shortest and longest span (or distance) between its elements. This exercise challenges you to use templated containers to handle dynamically-sized data sets efficiently.

#### Key Concepts

- Class templates
- Managing dynamic arrays
- Implementing complex algorithms to compute spans

### Exercise 02: Mutated Abomination

#### Purpose

Enhance the `std::stack` container by making it iterable. This exercise involves creating a `MutantStack` class that behaves like a standard stack but also supports iteration, showcasing how to extend STL containers.

#### Key Concepts

- Extending STL containers
- Implementing custom iterators
- Integrating STL behaviors with custom functionality

## Submission and Peer Evaluation

Ensure that your implementations utilize STL containers, iterators, and algorithms effectively. Your code will be evaluated for both correctness and adherence to modern C++ best practices, including efficient and safe use of memory and resources.

**Explore the capabilities of C++ to write more efficient and powerful applications by mastering these advanced programming techniques.**
