# C++ Module 01 - Exercises Overview

## Exercise 00: BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ

### Purpose

This exercise introduces you to the basics of class creation and dynamic memory management in C++. By designing a `Zombie` class, you'll learn how to manage objects using constructors, destructors, and member functions. The primary learning goal is to differentiate when to allocate objects on the stack versus the heap and understand the implications of each approach in terms of memory management.

### Key Concepts

- Class design
- Dynamic memory allocation (`new` and `delete`)
- Stack vs. Heap allocation
- Constructors and destructors for proper resource management

## Exercise 01: Moar brainz!

### Purpose

Expanding on the basic concepts learned in Exercise 00, you will create multiple instances of the `Zombie` class using a single function call. This exercise aims to solidify your understanding of arrays and pointers, particularly how to handle dynamic arrays in C++ for efficient memory usage.

### Key Concepts

- Dynamic arrays
- Pointer arithmetic
- Managing memory for an array of objects

## Exercise 02: HI THIS IS BRAIN

### Purpose

This exercise is designed to demystify the use of pointers and references in C++. You will manipulate a string variable through its direct memory address, a pointer, and a reference, highlighting the different ways to access and manipulate data in memory, which is crucial for efficient C++ programming.

### Key Concepts

- Pointers and pointer arithmetic
- References as an alternative to pointers
- Memory address manipulation

## Exercise 03: Unnecessary violence

### Purpose

Through the implementation of a `Weapon` class and its interaction with `HumanA` and `HumanB` classes, this exercise focuses on the relationship between objects in C++. It explores how objects can use other objects (composition), and the differences in handling objects directly versus through pointers.

### Key Concepts

- Object composition
- Class relationships
- Usage of pointers in class design
- Conditional object features

## Exercise 04: Sed is for losers

### Purpose

Simulating a basic text replacement tool, this exercise leverages file I/O alongside string manipulation to replicate the functionality of a stream editor for files. It teaches practical file handling and string operations, crucial for many real-world C++ applications.

### Key Concepts

- File input/output operations
- Advanced string manipulation techniques
- Error handling in file operations

## Exercise 05: Harl 2.0

### Purpose

`Harl 2.0` aims to introduce you to the concept of pointers to member functions. By automating a verbose character's complaints based on different levels of severity, you'll practice using this advanced feature to create more flexible and manageable code.

### Key Concepts

- Pointers to member functions
- Managing program flow based on input
- Modular design in class functions

## Exercise 06: Harl filter

### Purpose

Building on the previous exercise, `Harl filter` integrates the use of the `switch` statement to filter output based on predefined severity levels. This exercise enhances your understanding of control flow in C++, preparing you for scenarios requiring conditional logic based on user input or program state.

### Key Concepts

- Using `switch` statements effectively
- Filtering output based on enumerated types
- Dynamic response to user input

## Submission and Peer Evaluation

Ensure your code is well-organized, well-commented, and adheres strictly to the specified naming and formatting conventions. This will not only assist your peers during evaluation but also enhance your professional coding standards.
